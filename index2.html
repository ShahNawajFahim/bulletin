                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">JavaScript has three variable declaration statements: var, let and const. The
                        latter two were added in ES6, whereas var existed since previous versions. One of the first
                        things
                        to notice is that const defines constants (i.e. values that will not be reassigned), whereas var
                        and
                        let define variables. Yet, var behaves differently from both let and const in various other
                        ways.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-warning">1.Variables declared with var are function scoped, in contrast to variables
                        declared with let or
                        const which are block scoped.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">
                        2.While variables declared with var are hoisted to the enclosing scope, variables declared with
                        let
                        or const are not initialized until their definition is evaluated.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">forEach(), .map() and .filter(). When you go to loop through (or iterate
                        through) an array, the first thing you think of is probably a for loop. .forEach(), .map() and
                        .filter() are all just other ways of iterating through arrays to perform a specific task on each
                        element of the array, and are called methods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-warning">map : Transform elements in an array.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">filter : Select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">find : Select a single element from an array.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">forEach : forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-dark">Difference between arrow function and normal function</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in
                        ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular
                        JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences
                        between them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-warning">1.The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular
                        functions is their
                        syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return
                        shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.</p>
                    <p class="text-warning">2.Another difference is the binding of the arguments object. Unlike regular
                        functions, arrow
                        functions don't have their own arguments object. A modern alternative that circumvents this
                        limitation is the usage of rest parameters.</p>
